## E3Kit Android Java Firebase function

### Prerequisites
  - Android Studio 4.0.1+
  - [Firebase function](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-firebase-func) deployed successfully.

### How to start
Don't forget to deploy [Firebase function](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-firebase-func) first. It is a mandatory part of this sample. After this do next few steps:

```
  - git clone https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-kotlin
  - Open Android Studio -> File -> Open
  - Locate the recently cloned directory 'virgil-e3kit-kotlin' then go to 'samples/android-java-firebase-function' and click 'open'
```

After these steps you will be able to hit the `Run` button in Android Studio and get the sample to work.

If all works well - you will get Base64 string representation of encoded text on the screen and text "Success. Sample finished it's work.".

Current demo is supposed to be ran in an emulator (or real device) with firebase function successfully deployed and running.
